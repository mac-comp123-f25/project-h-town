"""Inspiration: We totally changed direction of our initial idea, but we wanted to continue on the path of Video games.
For each of our solo projects we created our own games about the sports we play. This time we wanted to form a game that
reminds us of the older easier games you could download or play at an arcade like Fruit ninja or Galaga. Galaga
was probably the main inspiration"""
